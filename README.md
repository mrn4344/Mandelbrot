# Mandelbrot Viewers
A collection of Mandelbrot Set viewers

### Objective
The objective of this repository is to develop programs for viewing the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). This project will be split into 2 parts: Python & C++.

## Python
The use of python here is just to be a proof of concept. Will only involve calculating whether points are in the Mandelbrot Set using a nieve approach. 

##### Python Objectives
1. Ensure correct methodology for computing if certain points are in the set.
2. Be able to generate correctly proportioned images.
3. Be able to apply gradient maps to color based on iteration.

##### Current Package Dependencies
1. Pillow
..* Can be installed on Windows, OSX, Linux using ```pip install pillow``` in a terminal/command prompt.
